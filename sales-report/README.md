# Sales Report (Beginner Project)

This is my beginner Power BI sales dashboard.

### What I did:
- Loaded sample sales data
- Cleaned and transformed the data
- Added Month Name and TotalRevenue columns
- Created KPI cards:
  - Total Revenue
  - Units Sold
  - Avg Price Per Unit
- Created a month-by-month revenue chart
- Created a map visual with bubble size increased
