# Sales Report (Beginner Power BI Project)

This is my beginner-friendly Sales Report created using Power BI.

## 📌 Steps I Performed

### 1. Loaded Sales Data
I imported a sample sales CSV/Excel file into Power BI.

### 2. Transformed the Data
In Power Query:
- Added **Month Name** column (from the date)
- Added **TotalRevenue** column  
  Formula: Unit Price * Units Sold  
- Cleaned the table and applied correct data types

### 3. Created KPI Cards
I added three card visuals:
1. Total Revenue  
2. Sum of Units Sold  
3. Average Price Per Unit

### 4. Created Visualizations
#### 📊 Monthly Revenue Trend
- Used a **Stacked Column Chart**
- X-axis: Month Name  
- Y-axis: Total Revenue  
- Sorted using Month Number for correct order

#### 🗺️ Revenue by State (Map)
- Added a **Map visual**
- Plotted revenue by states
- Enabled zoom in/out buttons
- Increased bubble size for better visibility

### 5. Final Touches
- Adjusted formatting and alignment
- Cleaned up the layout for readability
- Made the dashboard easy to understand
